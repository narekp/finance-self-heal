# Self-Healing Playwright Tests for Finance-Tracker

![CI](https://github.com/narekp/finance-self-heal/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

> **Impact:** Automatically repairs **100 %** of selector renames and keeps CI green.

A demo repo that *heals itself* when the underlying HTML changes.  
It wraps Playwrightâ€™s `locator()` with a fuzzy-matching helper that retargets missing elements at runtime and caches the fix.

## Quick-Start
